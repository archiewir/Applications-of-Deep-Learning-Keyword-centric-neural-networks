Final Year Project (FYP) - Application of Deep Learning: Keyword-centric Neural Networks

FYP is the capstone project of my undergraduate degree. 

Despite being an Energy Engineering student, my curiosity for data science and machine learning pushed me to pursue a study in Deep Learning.

I opted to challenge myself by choosing a topoic in Finance (Finance being my second major) and joined the conversation on efficient financial markets by beating the market.

This project aims to predict index movements through news headlines.

The purpose of this project was purely academic. Do consider your own financial risks when utilizing this algorithm.

All relavant scripts and the Technical paper is available here.
